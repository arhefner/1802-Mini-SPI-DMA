# 1802/Mini SPI DMA Rev A Notes and Errata

The Rev A design has an error in the silk screen for the N1 and N2 jumpers used to set the I/O address for the SPI port. The '0' and '1' labels are reversed. So, for example, to set the card to use ports 2&3, set the N2 jumper to '1', and the N1 jumper to '0'.
